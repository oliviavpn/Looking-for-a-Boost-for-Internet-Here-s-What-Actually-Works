## Slow internet kills the vibe  
Letâ€™s be real â€” slow internet is the worst. Buffering videos, laggy games, loading screens that never end... It drives anyone crazy. Iâ€™ve struggled with that too, and it pushed me to find real ways to get a boost for internet speed without calling tech support every five minutes.  

## What helped me boost my internet speed  
After testing a bunch of tips and tricks, hereâ€™s what actually made a difference for me:
- Moving my Wi-Fi router to a more open spot instead of hiding it in a corner
- Switching from 2.4GHz Wi-Fi to 5GHz for faster speeds when Iâ€™m close enough
- Using an Ethernet cable when I need the best connection possible, especially for work and gaming
- Cutting down on devices hogging bandwidth (yes, even that smart fridge!)
- Restarting my modem every now and then to clear up hiccups

And hereâ€™s the secret weapon: using a [proxy](https://9proxy.com/?utm_source=Web2.0&utm_medium=Github&utm_id=james2k4) service

## How a proxy gave me the boost for internet I needed

I started using [9Proxy](https://9proxy.com/?utm_source=Web2.0&utm_medium=Github&utm_id=james2k4) to connect through servers closer to those sites. The result? Faster loading times, smoother streams, and way less lag in games. Itâ€™s like giving my internet a turbo boost.
